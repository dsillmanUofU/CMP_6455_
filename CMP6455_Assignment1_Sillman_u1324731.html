In order to demonstrate this geographical distribution, a choropleth map was created using Census Tracts and crash data. This memo will address the workflow by which junior analysts created said map, a draft of the map, and some preliminary observations that were derived from the finished product.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Workflow:</p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="577" height="259" alt="image" src="CMP6455_Assignment1_Sillman_u1324731_files/Image_002.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The flow chart above portrays the process for creating the choropleth map.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Data sources included Utah.gov Open Data Catalog for crash data, Utah Automated Geographic Reference Center for county boundaries (via services.1.arcgis.com) and Census Tract boundaries. All of these data sets were state-wide. The first step was to collect data from these sources. Data for crashes in Utah from 2015-2019 were available in CSV form and had to be projected using the geometric information in the data set. While projecting the data, it is necessary to choose the projection coordinate system to be used. All coordinate projections were changed to EPSG: 3566, including crash data.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After each layer was exported as a new layer with the correct coordinate system, data had to be filtered to Salt Lake County from the state data sets. In order to accomplish this, the Salt Lake County shapefile</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">was filtered via attribute. The selection was then exported and the state-wide data was removed from the map. Using this layer, it is now possible to filter crash data and census tracts by location.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Beginning with census tract data, a selection by location within the new Salt Lake City layer and manually adding the census tracts that are immediately within the county boundary is followed by exporting the selected components and removing the original layer. This will reduce the number of census tracts to those within Salt Lake County. After this layer has been filtered, the crash data is selected by location within and intersecting the Salt Lake County layer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The two new layers are then joined using the special join summary tool. The operation for the join is “count”, the crash data is being joined to the census tract data. After the new layer is created from the join, it is possible to remove the census tract layer, it is also possible to remove the county layer. Using the properties menu for the new join layer, it is possible to create a categorized symbology. The Crash ID count was used as the value that was categorized. The mode used was Natural Breaks (Jenks).</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Finally, it is important to have some context for the census tracts, and in particular it is important to have the roadways visible in order to better understand the patterns of crashes throughout Salt Lake County. Open Streets basemap was used at a low transparency to give this context.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Map Characteristics:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 25pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="591" height="422" alt="image" src="CMP6455_Assignment1_Sillman_u1324731_files/Image_003.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The choropleth map above shows the joined layer after it had been categorized. Because the crash data set was so large and it is difficult to differentiate between data, the new layer can give the viewer more</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">information about where the highest concentration of crashes occurred. The map demonstrates that there are more crashes along Interstate 15, near the Salt Lake City International Airport, in canyon roadways, and clustered throughout the county. Using the natural breaks classification method helps to reduce variance within clusters, meaning that the clusters presented by different colors have fewer outliers than if a different method of classification was used. The census tracts with the highest number of crashes are grouped with much larger intervals than the census tracts with the lowest number of crashes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A potential limitation of this visualization is that there is no control for the amount of space that is included within each census tract. For example, the tract that include Little Cottonwood Canyon is far larger than several of the census tracts in the valley. Because the crash data is a count and not a rate, it may not be representative of the relative risk of driving in certain areas. However, in the case of Little Cotton Wood Canyon, there is a plausible causal relationship between the risk of the main roadway and the amount of traffic and the high number of crashes here.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Conclusion:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This map is an important component of the assessment requested by Salt Lake County. It is important to first demonstrate the Census Tracts that have a high number of crashes and the risks associated with this in order to inform the further question of equity.</p></body></html>
